# Coding Challenge

Welcome!

## Intro

This repository contains the coding "challenge", if you can call it that.

## Frontend challenge

Here is a live demo of the finished challenge: http://frontend-challenge.kingstonrivers.com/

Switch to branch frontend to see the code.

Here is a brief video of the demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/166Tl3sve3LuRmkZJ0Gzsedg2UdwRkSNZ/view

The task is to build a simple card game. See [design folder](./design) or [Sketch Cloud](https://www.sketch.com/s/40cd1ec0-8487-4053-a6ea-5d9a70076ebb) for what it should look like. It doesn't have to be pixel perfect, but it should look nice.

The program should perform the following functions.

1. Assuming a standard deck (52 cards of 4 suits: ♣ Clubs, ♦ Diamonds, ♥ Hearts, ♠ Spades).
2. Press a "Deal" button to deal 5 random cards.
3. Pressing the button again should deal 5 unique, random cards. Within the same game, you should never get the same cards again that you got in the past (just like a physical deck).
4. Add a card counter which shows how many cards are dealt/left.
5. Add a button to reset the game.
6. When all the cards have been dealt, Game Over should be displayed.
7. If there is an ace in the last draw, display You Win, otherwise display You Lose, Sucker.
8. Bonus: Animations.

Requirements:

- React
- Tailwind
